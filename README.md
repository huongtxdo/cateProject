## Checkpoint2

## Current properties

What properties have you already implemented into your project? I added some new files (itemToy, catFellow, errorInput, test.py...), fixed some functions (basically changed how I should use them), and create 3 simple tests in the test.py

What can be done with the program at this point? I think you can create a cat, eat some food that I have specied in itemFood, etc.


## Instructions

 - Is it possible to run the program already? (yes/no) no
 - How is the program executed? The program should be executed using the main.py file, which I haven't executed yet

## Schedule

 - How much time have you spent making the project this far? I guess around 7 hours (including the time I wrote my plan)
 - Have you made changes to the schedule of your project plan? there are delays because of other courses and thesis

## Other

 - Have you faced any specific problems? I want to create a separate dictionary of items, maybe a txt file, instead of writing everything in the code file. It is okay for now because there is not that many, but later I'd like to change/add items without having to open the code. 
 - Have you had to make changes to your plan? I still stick to my plan
